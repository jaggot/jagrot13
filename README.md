# jagrot13
I wanted to create an elegant algorithm that could perform the ROTn (see https://rot13.com/) encryption algorithm on any string of text, for any value of n.
I found that website I linked and I was inspired to invent my own algorithm that could produce the same results. In this case, I just print out all possible ROT combinations.
ROT3 = Caesar Cipher.

There might be a more efficient way of doing this, but this is just my implementation
